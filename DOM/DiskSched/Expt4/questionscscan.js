    question: "In _______ disk scheduling algorithm, the disk head moves from one end to other end of the disk, serving the requests along the way. When the head reaches the other end, it immediately returns to the beginning of the disk without serving any requests on the return.",
    answer: "C-SCAN",

      "The Head move from one end to the other of the disk while serving all the requests in between.",
      "The waiting time for the cylinders which were just visited by the head is reduced in C-SCAN compared to the SCAN Algorithm.",
